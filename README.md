# Shopping-Cart
A simple responsive shopping-cart made in react
It have a principal page where you can see all the products (fetched from https://fakestoreapi.com/)
And a buy section where you can buy all the products (you can't actually buy, but in these months i will be start working with backend :p )
I also use a design by Gianluks90 (Gianluca Marino) from uiverse for the credit card
